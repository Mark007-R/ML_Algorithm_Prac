## 📌 Algorithms Covered

### 🔹 1. Linear Regression
A supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous output based on one or more input features.

- **Concepts Covered:**
  - Line of best fit
  - Cost function (MSE)
  - Gradient descent
- **Implementation:** Using `scikit-learn` and from scratch

### 🔹 2. Logistic Regression (Classification)
A classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome.

- **Concepts Covered:**
  - Sigmoid function
  - Cost function (Log loss)
  - Decision boundary
- **Implementation:** Binary classification using `scikit-learn`

### 🔹 3. Decision Trees
A supervised algorithm used for both classification and regression by creating a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning decision rules from features.

- **Concepts Covered:**
  - Gini Index / Entropy
  - Information Gain
  - Tree pruning
- **Implementation:** Using `sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`

### 🔹 4. K-Means Clustering
An unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data into `k` clusters based on similarity.

- **Concepts Covered:**
  - Centroid initialization
  - Inertia and convergence
  - Elbow method
- **Implementation:** Using `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`
